==============
Why?
 - Non-Relational data base. (Mongodb, Redis, Cassandra, memcached)
 - In Amazon DocumentDB, the storage and compute are decoupled, allowing each to scale independently.
 - You can increase the read capacity to millions of requests per second by adding up to 15 low latency read replicas in minutes, regardless of the size of your data. 
 - Amazon DocumentDB is designed for 99.99% availability and replicates six copies of your data across three AWS Availability Zones (AZs).

Features and benefits:
 - MongoDB-compatible
 - Highly available
 - Performance at scale
 - Fully managed

Basic Points:
 - Version: Engine version is 4.0.0. , 5.0.0
 - Default port: 27017
 - Instance Type: R5, R6G

CloudWatch:
 CPU
  - CPU Utilization — The percentage of the computer processing capacity used.
 Memory
 - Freeable Memory — How much RAM is available on the instance.
 Swap Usage — How much swap space is used by the instance, in megabytes.
 
 Input/output operations
 - Read IOPS, Write IOPS — The average number of disk read or write operations per second.
 Read Latency, Write Latency — The average time for a read or write operation in milliseconds.
 Read Throughput, Write Throughput — The average number of megabytes read from or written to disk per second.
 Disk Queue Depth — The number of I/O operationsthat are waiting to be written to or read from disk.
