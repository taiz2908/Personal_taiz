============: ECS (Elastic Container Service) :=======================================
 - AWS managed container orchestration platform / AWS proprietary service. 
 - Manages the whole life cycle of a container (start,reschdule,stop,kill etc)
   
Drawbacks:
 - dont have features like k8s like Custom Resource defination (CRD). 
 - k8s is open source and lot of features and open source community 
 - ISTIO , Argo CD etc mostly support k8s
 - In k8s needs to configure Ingress controller. 
 - Advance security options. 

ECS :
 - Mostly we can use Fargate & EC2.   
 - Cost effective. 
 - Easy to create the cluster.  

Components of ECS:
 - Task Defination - how does the container looks like.
 - Clusters
 - Namespaces 

Cluster:
 - Need to create the cluster 
 - Vpc, subnet, Namespace 
 - Infrastructure 
  - AWS Fargate (managed automatically )
  - EC2
 - Cloudwatch Monitoring (default)
 - Create it. 

----
FIRST OF ALL : We need to login & build the dockerfile 
 - Login: aws ecr get-login-password --region <region_name> | --username AWS --password-stdin <registoy_name>
 - Building: docker build -t <registory_name i.e ecr>/<repository>:latest . 
 - Pushing to ECR: docker push <registory_name i.e ecr>/<repository>:latest

Now go to ECS:
 - Task definition -> Create Task Definition
 - Choose OS , Task size, 
 - Task Role (IAM role) - Allows Container in the task to make API requests to AWS Services.
 - Task Execution role - Used for the container agent to make AWS API requests on your behalf. 
  - Ex: Integrated with cloudwatch. 

Container -1 :
 - Name
 - Image url
 - Essential containers 
 Port Mapping:
 - container port
 - protocol
 - Port name
 - App Protocol
 Resource Allocation limits:
