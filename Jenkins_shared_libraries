======================
 - Common reusable code. 
 - store in one place
 - in Jenkinsfile we call the function in the name of shared-libraries and accordingly it'll executes.
 - written in .groovy extension.  

Advantages
 - Standarization of Pipelines
 - Reduce duplication of code
 - Easy onboarding of new applications, projects or teams
 - One place to fix issues with the shared or common code
 - Code Maintainence
 - Reduce the risk of errors

Shared libraries divided into three folders. 
 1. vars
 2. src 
 3. resources 

Ex: helloWorld.groovy
def call() {
  sh 'Hello World'
}

How to Configure in Jenkins?
 - Manage jenkins->Configure systems->global-pipeline libraries
 - Need to provide the branch name and git repo url. 

Jenkinsfile:
@Library("library_name") _ 
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('hello') {
      steps {
        helloWorld()
      }
    }
  }
}
