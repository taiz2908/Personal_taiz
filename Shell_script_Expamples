-----------------------------------------------------
Arithmatic Examples: [ +, -, /*, %, / ]
read a b
echo "addition: ` expr $a + $b `"
echo "Substraction: ` expr $a - $b `"
echo "Multiplication: ` expr $a \* $b `"
echo "Division: ` expr $a / $b `"
echo "Reminder: ` expr $a % $b `"

Relational Operators: 
-eq	Checks if the value of two operands are "equal" or not; if yes, then the condition becomes true.	
-ne	Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not; if values are "not equal", then the condition becomes true.	
-gt	Checks if the value of left operand is "greater than" the value of right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.
-ge	Checks if the value of left operand is "greater than or equal to" the value of right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.
-lt	Checks if the value of left operand is "less than" the value of right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.
-le	Checks if the value of left operand is "less than or equal to" the value of right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.

Logical Operators: Boolean 
!	This is logical negation. This inverts a true condition into false and vice versa.	
-o	This is logical OR. If one of the operands is true, then the condition becomes true.
-a	This is logical AND. If both the operands are true, then the condition becomes true otherwise false.

Statements:
1. simple if
 if [ condition ]; then
 echo "statement"
 fi

2. if else
 if [ condition ]; then
 echo "statement-1"
 else
 echo "statement-2"
 fi

3. if else if

4. nested if
 if [ condition ]; then
 echo "statement"
   if [ condition ]; then
   echo "statement-1"
   else
   echo "statement-2"
 else
 echo "statement"
 fi


-----------------: Scripts Examples: --------------------
Ex: commandsubstitution.
 current_directory=$(pwd)
 echo "present directory is: " $current_directory
 newfile=`cat>file.txt`
 echo $newfile

Ex: How to use the parameters.
 echo $0
 echo $1
 # name=$0
 # echo $@ --> show all the parameters. 
 # echo $# --> show how many parameters pass
 # echo "my name is : " $name -->store the parameters

 o/p: file.sh "ibraur ahemad" 31

Ex: Task-1 ,
 - Read the input from the user i.e. ip / domain name
 - using the ping cmd to ping the server
 
 read -p "which server you want to ping" server_ip
 ping c5 -w5 $server_ip

Ex: Task-2,
 - Remote M/C using bash script

 read -p "enter the username: " username
 read -p "enter the password: " IP
 ssh $username@$IP
or, # passing the parameters. 
 username=$1
 IP=$2
 ssh $username@$IP

Ex: Case statement,
 read -p "enter grade: " grade
 case $grade in
 A) echo "marks between 90-100"
 ;;
 B) echo "marks between 70-90"
 ;;
 c) echo "marks between 50-60"
 ;;
 *)
 echo "marks below 40"
 esac

Ex: Array, data structure for storing multiple values in a single variables.
 value=(Ahemad Ganesh Ram);
 echo ${value[1]}
 echo ${value[*]} # printing all array's

Ex: For Loop,


=================================================================================================================

Ex:1, To check file is present in a specific location or not,
 - Note:  If directory then use -d in place of -f

 #! /bin/bash
 file=/opt/demo.txt
 if [ -f "$file" ];then
 echo "file is present"
 else
 echo "file is not present"
 fi

Ex:2, Printing 1-10.
a=1
while [ $a -le 10 ] ;do
echo "$a"
((a++))
done

Ex:3, Taking i/p and doing arithmatic operations.
 read a b
 echo "Addition: `expr $a + $b `"
 echo "Substraction: `expr $a - $b `"
 echo "Multiplication: `expr $a \* $b `"
 echo "Division: `expr $a / $b `"
 echo "Reminder: `expr $a % $b `"
or,
 read a b
 echo "Addition: " $((a+b))

Ex:4, Taking i/p and Comparing among three Big number.
 read a b c
 if [ $a -gt $b -a $b -gt $c ];then
 echo "a is big"
 elif [ $b -gt $c ];then
 echo "b is big"
 else
 echo "c is big"
 fi

Ex:5, Printing 1-10.
 num=1
 while [ $num -le 10 ];do
 echo "$num"
 ((num++)) #increment by 1
 done

Ex:6, Printing 10 to 1.
 num=10
 while [ $num -ge 1 ];do
 echo "$num"
 ((num--)) #decrement by 1
 done

Ex:7 Printing 10 to 1 in a single line by using for loop
 for (( counter=10; counter>0; counter-- ))
 do
 echo -n "$counter "
 done

Ex:7,
read num
a=1
while [ $a -le 10 ]; do
c=`expr $a \* $num`
echo "$num * $a = $c"
((a++))
done
