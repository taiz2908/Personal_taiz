=======================
1.

2. Subnets:
 - slipt into large n/w into grouping of small interconnected n/w to minimise the traffic. 

3. Private N/w:
 - Control by entirely single organisation. 
 - Within the org.
  Public N/W:
 - External user can acccess. 

4. CIDR: "Classless Inter-Domain Routing"
 - Amount of bits. allocated to the n/w
 - /24 , means 24 allocated to n/w, 8 bit allocated to hosts.

5. Static vs Dynamic IP:
 - Dynamic IP means public IP i.e., when we reboot the ec2 instance ip will change
 - So we required static ip

6. Firewall:
 - N/w security device. 

7. Proxy:
 - system/router -> gateway between internet & users. 

8. Public & Private DNS: 
 - AWS -> Route53

9. VPN:
 - Enables private connection between two m/c or n/w over a shared public n/w.

10. protocols:
   - http (80)
   - https (443)
   - ftp (21)
   - tcp
   - ssh (22)
   - ssl/tls (465)
   - smtp (25)
