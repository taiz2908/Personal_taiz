   - we have task sections we can configure (template) like if we choose docker it'll provide build, push etc
   - job: we can run parallel jobs.
     - Under the job we need to define the steps.
     - if we have multiple job we can define multiple jobs and mention "pool" section under it. 

 - Azure Artifacts:
   - Maven packages
   - nuget.exe
   - npm
   - Also we can build the application and create the docker image and store it in "azure container registry".

  - Manual Test cases
  - Automated Test cases
