Intro:
 - SaaS platform
 - 
Components:
 1. Azure Boards
 2. Azure Pipeline
 3. Azure Repos
 4. Azure Test Plans
 5. Azure Artifacts

 - Create the New project for the application

 1. Azure Boards: (Can create tickets, tasks, bugs, task, feature etc) --> kind of Jira Board
 - Need to define Agile / scrum

 2. Azure Repos: (Code repo) --> github, bitbucket, gitlab etc
   - pull requests
   - branches
   - commits

 3. Azure Pipeline: (.yaml)
   - Env (Create env and can configure in the pipeline --> view the deployments)
   - Release (Only created by UI)
   - Library
   - Tasks groups
   - Deployment groups
   - we have task sections we can configure (template) like if we choose docker it'll provide build, push etc
   - job: we can run parallel jobs.
     - Under the job we need to define the steps.
     - if we have multiple job we can define multiple jobs and mention "pool" section under it. 

 4. Azure Artifacts:
   - Maven packages
   - nuget.exe
   - npm
   - Also we can build the application and create the docker image and store it in "azure container registry".

5. Azure Test Plans: (centralized)
  - Manual Test cases
  - Automated Test cases
---
 - Build
 - Deploy (Deployment jobs)

---------
Service Connection:
 - To connect & interact with other platforms. 
 - Need to authentication . (secure & automatically created the credentials)
