-> Project Mgmt & Comprehensive tool written in Java 
-> pom.xml - Project Object Model , Extensible Markup Language
-> In project we have one "parent pom" , and every module have separate pom.

Old - ANT
New - Gradel
Dependencies- Its refers to the Java liberares that are needed for the project.

Main file is "pom.xml" contains info about the project & various configuration details.
Also it contains 
- project Info
- metadata
- goals 
- plugins
- Dependencies etc.

Ex: GAV's in POM: groupID, artifactID, version
    <groupId>sathya</groupId>
    <artifactId>TestProject</artifactId>
    <version>1.5</version>
    <packaging>war</packaging>
    <name>myproj</name>

default value for <packaging> : jar

Maven Goal / Build Life cycle: 
 - mvn clean: to clean the repo / Previous project to be clean
 - mvn site - Aslo it will generate reports.(project license, project summery, dependencies, CI reports etc and create a html docs)
 - mvn compile: to compile the source code of the project , Executable files.
 - mvn Test: to apply test cases. 
 - mvn package: to generate the package,executable files, i.e .war / .jar
 - mvn install: install the package in the local repo in mvn i.e. ".m2"
 - mvn deploy: to deploy in nexus repo
 
mvn deploy :
 Whatever artifact generated it'll store under "target" folder.

In Pom.xml: 
 Under <distributionManagement> section we need to define where we should push our artifact.
 and <id> should match with setting.xml within .m2 folder and also we need to define the nexus credentils.
 <url> nexus url <url>
 <snapshotRepository> related to DEV env. 

Ex:
<distributionManagement>
    <repository>
      <id>internal.repo</id>
      <url>Host to Company Repository</url>
    </repository>
  </distributionManagement>
or,
<distributionManagement>
   <snapshotRepository>
      <id>nexus-snapshots</id>
      <url>http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
   </snapshotRepository>
</distributionManagement>

 =============================================================================
 Maven Deploy Plugin:
  - The deploy plugin is primarily used during the deploy phase, to add your artifact(s) to a remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects. 
  - This is usually done in an integration or release environment. It can also be used to deploy a particular artifact 
<plugin>
   <artifactId>maven-deploy-plugin</artifactId>
   <version>2.8.1</version>
   <executions>
      <execution>
         <id>default-deploy</id>
         <phase>deploy</phase>
         <goals>
            <goal>deploy</goal>
         </goals>
      </execution>
   </executions>
</plugin>
