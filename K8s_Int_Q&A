  ========================================================
  K8s Version: 1.17
  v1.26 -->latest
  v1.25 
  v1.24
  v1.23

  kubeadm --> setup
 
 1. what are the Day-to-day activities of k8s / currently working in k8s +  have you written helm charts?
  - use to write deployment files
  - service files
  - writing & modifing helm charts as per the project req , package and deploy to k8s cluster
  - checking pod logs.
  - Admin side - ??
  - we also ensure the application deployed into the k8s cluster and there is no issue's with the application.
  - we deployed monitoring tools.
  - providing support to our developers like networks, services. 
  - maintenance activities comes - ??

2. Architechture of k8s:
  - Master Node / Control Plane (3 Node): Scheduler , API Server, ETCD, Control manager, Cloud manager , Container runtime , Kubelet, Kubeproxy .
  - Worker Node: Kubelet , Kube-proxy, Container runtime (Docker engine / CRI-O / Containerd), Pod(IP Address, Volume, Docker). 

3. Controllers: 
  Why :
     - Self Healing, if any pods goes down , bringing back is called self healing.
     - Roll-out & Roll-back, 1.21 --> 1.22 & 1.22 --> 1.21
     - High Availability
  Types: & Why with example ?
    1. ReplicaSet --> desired count/replicas & actual count matches, any mismatch going to do self healing.
    2. Deployment --> Gives us rollout & rollback
       Deployment strategies:  Two types
        - Recreate, 1st Terminating previous version then recreate / deploy new application versions - Downtime
        - RollingUpdate , default strategy, first creating the pods then terminating. 
    3. DeamonSet --> One pod per node. Each and evey node (Prometheus & grafana to monitor k8s cluster)
    4. statefulSet --> Maintain a sticky identity for each of their pods. (Data base servers)

4. What are all objects you used in K8s?
 - deployment
 - service
 - replicaSet
 - configMaps
 - ingress controller 

5. Once you deployed application using deployment into cluster, how do you access application outside world?
 - once deployment is done
 - we need to write nodePort service 
 - Also we can use ingress controller 

6. k8s services:
 - Enabling network. 
  1. ClusterIP ( Port - 443 / TCP ) --> default 
  2. NodePort ( 30,000 - 32,767) / TCP --> Stable IP Address.
     - <node_ip>:<nodePort_ip>
  3. LoadBalancer --> more of network load balancer. ( Layer 4)
     - end-user's - need to expose the application outside cluster. 
     - Requires public IP / External IP
     - will work when deploy to EKS, AKS, GKE etc. 
  4. Ingress:  --> Application Load balancer (layer 7)
     - http/https
     - path based routing()
     - host based routing
     - content 
Difference between NodePort & LoadBalancer:
  NodePort: 
     - when a service is created as a nodeport, the kube-proxy updates the IPtables with <node_ip_address> and 
      the <port> that is choosen at the service conf to access the pods.
  LoadBalancer:
     - when a service is created as a loadbalancer, cloud controll manager creates a external load balancer ip
     using the underlying cloud provide.

7. K8s Volume Types:
 - cephs
 - configMap
 - emptydir
 - persistentvolume
 - persistentVolumeClaim
 - local
 - nfs
 - hostpath
 - secret
 - fc (fibre channel)

ConfigMaps and Secrets:
 - Kubernetes that enable decoupling of configuration data and secrets from container images, allowing for better management and security of applications.

ConfigMaps:
 - store the data in key-value pairs in "plain text".
 - storing the application configuration files.
 - allows to decouple environment-specific configuration from the container image.
Note:
 - There are four different ways that you can use a ConfigMap to configure a container inside a Pod:
 1. Inside a container command and args
 2. Environment variables for a container
 3. Add a file in read-only volume, for the application to read
 4. Write code to run inside the Pod that uses the Kubernetes API to read a ConfigMap
Secrets:
 - store the data in "encrypted format".
 - Ex: passwords, API keys, and certificates

8. Explain static pods in K8s?
 - Static Pods are managed directly by the "kubelet daemon" on a specific node
 - Use Cases of Using Static Pods :
   - Static pods are usually used by different software for bootstrapping Kubernetes itself. 
   - For example, kubeadm uses static pods to bring up Kubernetes control plane components like api-server, controller-manager as static pods on the Master Node.
 - /etc/kubernetes/manifests -> keep our yaml files and creates the pods.

9. Do you know high availability in pod level?  "Readnessprob" & "Livenessprob / Healthcheck"
Livenessprob:
 - Application Healthcheck.
 - In Order to verify whether application is running or not within the container we can use livenessprob. 
      initialDelaySeconds: 5          
      periodSeconds: 5                                 
      timeoutSeconds: 30 
ReadnessProb:
  - readiness probes to know when a container is ready to start accepting traffic.
Ex;
 - Sometimes, applications are temporarily unable to serve traffic. 
 - For example, an application might need to load large data or configuration files during startup, or depend on external services after startup. 
 - In such cases, you don't want to kill the application, but you don't want to send it requests either. Kubernetes provides readiness probes to detect and mitigate these situations.

10. Is it possible to deply pod in master?
 - Yeah , Its Possible
 - some "taints" will be there in master, but if we apply some tolerance we can deploy to master. 

11. Is it possible to decide to deploy pod in particular node?
 - Yes, we can do that
 - "nodeSelector" we can do that, also we can use nodeAffinity. 

12. To upgrade K8s version, what steps you will follow?
 - we need to take off the pods from the nodes. 
 - Move to node1 to node2.i.e., cordorton. 
 - we can do upgradation 
 - 

13. Init Containers:
 - A Pod can have multiple containers running apps within it, but it can also have one or more init containers, which are run before the app containers are started.
 - Init containers can contain utilities or setup scripts not present in an app image.

14. By default how many namespaces are available in kubernetes?
  1. Default - By default resource created  within default namespace , Resource when we don't specify namespace explicitly
  2. Kube-node-lease - Contains lease resources to send the heart_beats of node , if nodes goes down , so Pods within that node will be created with healthy node . Lease will take action . 
  3. kube-public - Used for public resource . Open to all users with read only access. 
  4. kube-system - For Objects created by k8s (etcd,apiserver,kubeproxy,scheduler,control manager)
 
Namespaces:
  - Way to organise the cluster into the virtual sub-clusters, so we are creating the resources (pod,svs,rs,deployment,secrets,ingress,configs) in these namespaces instead of creating all in one namespaces. 
  - Each namespace logically separated with each other but can communicate with each other. 
Need of Namespace?
   - Avoid conflicts like same name between teams.
   - Restricting Access like Dev & Prod .
   - Resource limits by using resource quota , i.e allocated to the individual application according to their requirement .(CPU,RAM,Storage per NS etc)
   
15. Why we use networking solutions like flannel or calico?
 - Use : We have some nodes & keep creating the pods, and having ip add of the pod , if creating again created with same IP, thats why we need networking solutions. 

16. RBAC Authorization?
 - An RBAC Role or ClusterRole contains rules that represent a set of permissions. Permissions are purely additive (there are no "deny" rules).
 - A Role always sets permissions within a particular namespace; when you create a Role, you have to specify the namespace it belongs in.

17. What is use of PV and PVC?
Pod request the volume through the PV claim, claim tries to find a volume in cluster, Volume has the actual storage backend. 
 - PV & PVC: --> Real world, --> infra team will provide the storage. 
 - Cluster-wide resource used to store the data beyond the lifetime of a pod.
 - in order to use pv , we need to first claim it using pvc.
 - size, speed, read write properties etc
--------------
 Storage Admin
  - PV1 3gb
  - PV2 2gb --> bound
  - PV3 500mb 

18. What is Ingress?
  - We can access the application from outside of the cluster. 
  - We declare which request should go to which service.So we should write the ingress rule for this. 
  - For ingress rule we should have deploy "Ingress Controller" pod into our cluster to process the ingress rule.
  - Ingress Controller could be an entrypoint to the cluster.
How it Works ? 
 - http-->load balancer-->ingress controller-->reads ingress rules-->forwards to service-->pod

19. Did you face any challenge in application while setting K8s cluster or while deploying application?
 - resource quota full in namespace
 - during claim pvc its mismatch with: volumeMounts "name" & volumes "name", i.e., should match.
 - selector issue, pod labels & matchLabels should be match 

20. Why not docker swarm instead of K8s??
 - Cluster is not robust.
 - K8s Autoscaling , if pod dies automatically its create a new one
 - rolling update.
 - CNCF - integrate tools for logging & monitoring like promethus & grafana etc. 

21. Docker Container vs K8s POD ?
 - k8S pod is a runtime speficiation of a container --> Pod
 - In a Pod can create multiple container.
 





 2. what are the error's facing in k8s?
  - Mountvolume.setup failed --> we need to create a dir
    - mkdir /data

 3. have you created deployment file?
  Yes, 
  Ex:
==============================: Real Time Qus :===================================================================
1. What are the challenges yoy've faced in prometheus ?
 - Prometheus HA support

2. How to handle k8s cluster security ?
 - save the secretes 
 - we can set up network policies to limit this communication between the pods
 - Use namespace for multi tenancy support.
 - RBAC 
 - Turn on audit logging.

3. If two containers running in a single pod how to access , How does it internally ?
 - by using <localhost>:<port_number>
 - K8s handle this by using "Pause container" .

4. What is Service Mesh, why do we need it ?
 - 
 - 
5. What is pod Disruption budget ?

==============================: Helm :=============================================================================
1. What and why we need helm charts? What helm charts version that you have worked with? and difference between helm 3 and helm 2? 
 - Refer K8S Intro

2. What are the files and folders in helm charts and explain briefly about files & folders?
 - Directory structure: ls
<Chart.yaml charts/ templates/ values.yaml>

  # tree mycharts
  mycharts/ -->folder
  - Charts.yaml --> meta info about chart, name, version,description, dependecies etc.
  - values.yaml --> Imp one, place where all the values can be configure/ default value can be configured .
  - charts/ --> folder contain chart dependecies. 
  - templates/ -->folder contains actual templates files stored.
    - .txt
    - _helpers.tpl
    - deployment.yaml
    - ingress.yaml
    - service.yaml
    - serviceaccount.yaml
Note:
- 1st values. yaml 
- values.yaml validating json schema. 
Validating charts value in JSON schema.
