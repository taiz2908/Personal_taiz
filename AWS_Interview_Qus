1. Security group vs NACL.

2. Single part vs multipart upload mechanism in S3 bucket .
 - Multipart Upload:
    - Multi-part Upload
    - parallelizes upload
    - recommended for files > 100MB (when your object size reaches 100 MB, you should consider using multipart uploads instead of uploading the object in a single operation.)
    - must use for files > 5GB
    
3. S3 lifecycle policy.
 - To manage your objects so that they are stored cost effectively throughout their lifecycle, 
 - An S3 Lifecycle configuration is a set of rules that define actions(XML) that Amazon S3 applies to a group of objects. There are two types of actions:
 - Transition actions & Expiration actions 

4. EKS Cluster.
5. Application load balancer vs Network Load balancer
6. role vs policies
  - Create the "policies" after that gives the access to the s3 bucket
  - need to attached to a "role"
  
7. If EC2 disk space full, what actions will take to mitigate ?
  - First need to check root volume / application EBS volume. 
  - If issue with root then need to check /var/log
  - application /tmp
  - need to take the snapshot increase disk space.
