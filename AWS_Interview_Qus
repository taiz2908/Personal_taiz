Major AWS Services:
 - EC2
 - IAM
 - EBS
 - S3
 - Auto Scaling
 - ELB
 - VPC
 - Route 53
 - DynamoDB
 - SNS
 - SQS
 - ECS
 - EKS

1. Security group vs NACL.

2. Single part vs multipart upload mechanism in S3 bucket .
 - Multipart Upload:
    - Multi-part Upload
    - parallelizes upload
    - recommended for files > 100MB (when your object size reaches 100 MB, you should consider using multipart uploads instead of uploading the object in a single operation.)
    - must use for files > 5GB
    
3. S3 lifecycle policy.
 - To manage your objects so that they are stored cost effectively throughout their lifecycle, 
 - An S3 Lifecycle configuration is a set of rules that define actions(XML) that Amazon S3 applies to a group of objects. There are two types of actions:
 - Transition actions & Expiration actions 

4. EKS Cluster.

5. Application load balancer vs Network Load balancer
  - Load balancing to multiple applications (target groups) based on the request parameters.
  - Distributes incoming traffic accross multiple targets such as EC2 in multiple AZ.
  - Operates at Layer 7 (HTTP, HTTPS and WebSocket)
---
  - Operates at Layer 4 (TCP, UDP)
  - Can handle millions of request per seconds (extreme performance)
  - Lower latency ~ 100 ms (vs 400 ms for ALB)
  - Ability to handle volatile workloads.

6. role vs policies
  - Create the "policies" after that gives the access to the s3 bucket
  - need to attached to a "role"
  - IAM role is a set of permissions that grant access to the actions & resources in aws.
  
7. If EC2 disk space full, what actions will take to mitigate ?
  - First need to check root volume / application EBS volume. 
  - If issue with root then need to check /var/log
  - application /tmp
  - need to take the snapshot increase disk space.
