============: Major AWS Services: =======
 - EC2
   - General Purpose
   - Compute Optimized
   - Memory Optimized
   - Storage Optimized
  Purchasing Options:
   - On-demand Instances
   - Spot Instances
   - Dedicated Hosts
   - Dedicated Instances
   - Standard Reserved Instances
  Instance States:
   - Stop
   - Terminate
   - Hybernate
   - Standby

 - IAM
   - Users: User can belong to multiple groups
   - Groups : Groups are collections of users and have policies attached to them
   - IAM User has limited permission to the account
   - Policies: Policies are JSON documents that outline permissions for users, groups or roles
     - User based policies
       - IAM policies define which API calls should be allowed for a specific user
     - Resource based policies
       - Control access to an AWS resource
   - Roles: Collection of policies for AWS services

 - EBS
   - Bound to an AZ
   - By default, upon instance termination, the root EBS volume is deleted and any other attached EBS volume is not deleted.
   - To replicate an EBS volume across AZ or region, need to copy its snapshot
   - EBS Multi-attach allows the same EBS volume to attach to multiple EC2 instances in the same AZ
  Types:
   - General Purpose SSD : Good for system boot volumes, virtual desktop
   - Provisioned IOPS SSD :Transaction-intensive Applications with high frequency of small & random IO operations. 
   - Hard Disk Drives (HDD) :Throughput-intensive Applications that require large & sequential IO operations and are less sensitive to increased I/O latency 
  Snapshots:
   - Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM) can be used to automate the creation, retention, and deletion of snapshots of EBS volumes.
   - Snapshots are incremental
   - Only the most recent snapshot is required to restore the volume

 - S3

 - CloudWatch
   - 
   - 

 - Lambda
   - Serverless (short actions/functionality)
   - we can directly run the application. 

 - Auto Scaling

 - ELB 
   - N/w LB 
     - Operates at Layer 4 (TCP, UDP)
     - Can handle millions of request per seconds (extreme performance)
     - Lower latency ~ 100 ms (vs 400 ms for ALB)
     - 1 static public IP per AZ (vs a static hostname for CLB & ALB)
     - Elastic IP can be assigned to NLB
   - App LB
     - Load balancing to multiple applications (target groups) based on the request parameters
     - Operates at Layer 7 (HTTP, HTTPS and WebSocket)
     - Provides a fixed hostname (xxx.region.elb.amazonaws.com)
     - ALB terminates the upstream connection and creates a new downstream connection to the targets (TCP termination)
     - Security Groups can be attached to ALBs to filters requests
     - Great for micro services & container-based applications (Docker & ECS)
   - Gateway LB
     - Operates at layer 3 (Network layer) - IP Protocol
     - Used to route requests to a fleet of 3rd party virtual appliances like Firewalls, Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS), etc.
     - Performs two functions:
       - Transparent Network Gateway (single entry/exit for all traffic)
       - Load Balancer (distributes traffic to virtual appliances)
  Cross-zone Load Balancing:

 - VPC
   - Create VPC
   - Create subnet
   - Create Route table
   - Create Internet Gateway

 - Route 53
   - DNS

 - DynamoDB
 - SNS
 - SQS
 - ECS (Elastic Container Service)
   - AWS managed container orchestration platform. / AWS proprietary service
 - EKS
   - Managed k8s service. 
   - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-console.html

 - ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
   - AWS managed private Docker repository
   - Pay for the storage you use to store docker images (no provisioning)
   - Integrated with ECS & IAM for security
   - Storage backed by S3
   - Can upload Docker images on ECR manually or we can use a CICD service like CodeBuild

 - Fargate
 - Cloudformations(CFT)
 - KMS
 - CloudTrail
 -

==============: AWS CLI :=============
- Version : Version 2
# aws version - to check properly installed or not
# aws configure
 - AWS access key ID
 - AWS Secrete key ID
# aws s3 ls
# aws s3 mb <bucket_name> - create bucket
# aws s3 rb - Delete buckets
# aws s3 rm - Delete objects
# aws s3 mv <source> <target> - Move objects
# aws s3 cp <source> <target> - copy objects

=============: Cloudformation :======================================
How to create?
 - Create stack
 - if template is present then need to choose "template is ready"
 - template source [S3, Upload a template file]
 - Next --> Done

====================: AWS INTERVIEW QUS :=========================================================

1. Security group vs NACL.

2. Single part vs multipart upload mechanism in S3 bucket .
 - Multipart Upload:
    - Multi-part Upload
    - parallelizes upload
    - recommended for files > 100MB (when your object size reaches 100 MB, you should consider using multipart uploads instead of uploading the object in a single operation.)
    - must use for files > 5GB
    
3. S3 lifecycle policy.
 - To manage your objects so that they are stored cost effectively throughout their lifecycle, 
 - An S3 Lifecycle configuration is a set of rules that define actions(XML) that Amazon S3 applies to a group of objects. There are two types of actions:
 - Transition actions & Expiration actions 

4. EKS Cluster.

5. Application load balancer vs Network Load balancer
  - Load balancing to multiple applications (target groups) based on the request parameters.
  - Distributes incoming traffic accross multiple targets such as EC2 in multiple AZ.
  - Operates at Layer 7 (HTTP, HTTPS and WebSocket)
---
  - Operates at Layer 4 (TCP, UDP)
  - Can handle millions of request per seconds (extreme performance)
  - Lower latency ~ 100 ms (vs 400 ms for ALB)
  - Ability to handle volatile workloads.

6. role vs policies
  - Create the "policies" after that gives the access to the s3 bucket
  - need to attached to a "role"
  - IAM role is a set of permissions that grant access to the actions & resources in aws.
  
7. If EC2 disk space full, what actions will take to mitigate ?
  - First need to check root volume / application EBS volume. 
  - If issue with root then need to check /var/log
  - application /tmp
  - need to take the snapshot increase disk space.
