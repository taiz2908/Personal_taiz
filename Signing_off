Thank You & Signing Off !!
Hi Team, 
Hope all are doing well !!
As some of you may already know, today is my last working day with this <project> and I'm moving on to a new chapter in my carrer. So, I want to take this opportunity to thank each one of you for professionally grooming and helping me with all my quiries. As I move on to the next phase of my professional life, I thank you for being a remarkable set of people whom I've greatly enjoyed working with.

I'm not going to mention any special thanks with their names because everyone is special for me in one or other way.

Best wishes to all. Stay Happy & Healthy !!.
