==================================================================================
What us Prometheus ?
- Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting system,
 helps you collect and store metrics about your software systems and infrastructure,
 and analyze that data to gain insights into their health and performance. 

- It provides a powerful query language, a flexible data model, and a range of integrations with other tools and systems. 
- We can easily monitor metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, network traffic, & application-specific metrics, 
 and use that data to troubleshoot issues, optimize performance, and create alerts to notify you when things go wrong.
- execute some promQL quries. 

Architecture:
 Component Prometheus Server: which scrapes and stores time series data
  - It has "http server"
  - Collects all the info from k8s cluster, and collect those metrics and stores into "TSDB" (time series data base)
  - Also we can configure "Aleart Manager", notify through mail/ ms-teams channel's etc.

What is Grafana ?
 - For better visualization. 
 - Need to create the "data source" and "dashboard".
 - For dashboard--> import --> 3662

prometheus-Kube-state-metrics:
 - gives info about k8s api-server and more about k8s cluster. 
 - info about deployment, services, replica count etc 
 Advantage of additional metrics:
  - kube-metrics 
  - whether expose or not , and url ? we can get the lot of quries from that 

INSTALLATION ?
 - helm
 - operators - offers lot of advance capabilities, upgradation prometheus and lots of things 

===================================================================================
 - Spin up the server's by using Ansible Playbooks.
 - VM provisioned by using Terraform.
Applications:
  - Jenkins url's
  - Nexus url's
  - Sonarqubke url's
  - vault
  - Aquasec
  - NexsusIQ

  - Using "pull metric's" to pulls the data and store's in a data base i.e, time series data base. , Grafana reads the data and show in a 
  visual way.
  - By using pull metric's Alertmanager send the notifications to mail/ms teams etc.

Roles & Responsibilities:
 - If any new target added then I've to update it under host inventory file (IP addr)
 - execute the cmd from ansible host m/c , ansible playbook pb1.yaml file.
